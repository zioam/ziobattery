--ZIOBATTERY'S FUNCTIONALITY--
It's main purpose is pretty straight forward: 
1) detect the current battery level.
2) Set a desired value using the slider.
3) Once you press the "set" button, the application will automatically know if the battery == value.
4) If yes, a notification will be triggered to let the user know that the device's charge is ready.

--EXTRA--
As the current date of this being written (October 5th, 2025), this is what to expect as the following updates and changes in the future:
1) GUI improvements.
2) Settings.
3) Themes (maybe).
4) Notification sounds customization.
5) More functions such as battery monitoring in general (quality, life, voltages, consumption rate).
   
ziobattery's current version is 1.0 (the very first one, just released!), as time goes by, future versions will come and eventually once this app reaches a good perfomance, the updates are going to be less and QoL.
